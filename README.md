# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Project Summary
In this module, I first installed the mlenv, machine learning environment to evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. The output statistics can offer banks past information to analyze on and help banks predict on future uncertainties.

## Algortithms appled to analyze and find the one with best performance 
`Naive Random Oversampling`
`SMOTE Oversampling`
`Undersampling`
`Combination Sampling`
`Balanced Ramdom Sampling`
